## Doctrine Overview Section

### Section Title
```
The Five Pillars of CTB Doctrine
Built for systems that scale, maintained by teams that care
```

### HEIR Card
```
🏛️ HEIR CANOPY
History • Enforcement • Integrity • Repair

The overarching compliance framework that governs everything below. 
Every CTB system runs under HEIR discipline - no exceptions.

Key Concepts:
• History: Decision trails and evolution tracking
• Enforcement: Policy compliance and violation handling  
• Integrity: Validation and audit trails
• Repair: Recovery procedures and rollback plans
```

### IMO Card
```
📊 VERTICAL IMO
Input → Middle → Output

NOT simple input/output mapping. IMO is a vertical planning mechanism 
where the Middle contains the orchestration bay - the operational heart 
of every node.

The Middle Section Contains:
• Tools and orchestrator definitions
• Promotion gates and firebreaks
• Contracts and failure handling
• Observability and monitoring
```

### ORBT Card
```
🔄 ORBT DISCIPLINE  
Operate • Repair • Build • Train

Applied as a discipline lens to every single node in your CTB. 
No more "how do I fix this?" - every component has clear operational guidance.

Four Pillars:
• Operate: How to run the system day-to-day
• Repair: How to fix when things break
• Build: How to enhance and extend
• Train: How to onboard and learn
```

### CARB Card
```
⚡ CARB RUNTIME
Compliance • Automation • Repair • Blueprint

Optional runtime overlay that adds advanced operational capabilities 
to nodes that need them. Think of it as "enterprise features" for critical nodes.

Runtime Features:
• Compliance: Regulatory adherence
• Automation: Self-healing processes  
• Repair: Advanced recovery mechanisms
• Blueprint: Connection to master blueprint
```

### Schema Card
```
🗄️ SCHEMA GROUNDING
STAMPED • SPVPET • STACKED

Three-tier data foundation that grounds every CTB in real persistence layers. 
No floating abstractions - everything connects to actual databases.

The Three Tiers:
• STAMPED (Neon): PostgreSQL vault for persistence
• SPVPET (Firebase): Real-time working memory
• STACKED (BigQuery): Analytics and reporting layer
```

## IMO Deep Dive Section

### Section Title
```
The Heart: Vertical IMO Structure
Why IMO is NOT simple input/output
```

### Problem Statement
```
❌ Common Mistake: "IMO is just input → process → output"
✅ Reality: IMO is a vertical planning mechanism with operational intelligence
```

### Three-Column Explanation

#### Input Column
```
📥 INPUT
What Flows In

• Business requirements
• Technical constraints  
• Context and variables
• Upstream deliverables

Think: "What does this node need to do its job?"
```

#### Middle Column (EMPHASIZED)
```
⚙️ MIDDLE
The Orchestration Bay

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:
• 🎭 Orchestrator: Who/what manages this node
• 🔧 Tools: What tools does it use
• 📋 Operations: Specific computational steps
• 🚪 Promotion Gates: Quality gates before output
• 🔥 Human Firebreaks: Manual intervention points
• 📊 Observability: Monitoring and tracing
• 🔧 Failure Handling: What to do when things break

The Middle is where all the operational intelligence lives.
```

#### Output Column
```
📤 OUTPUT  
What Flows Out

• Validated deliverables
• Status reports
• Downstream inputs
• Evidence of completion

Think: "What can other nodes depend on from here?"
```

### Key Insight Box
```
💡 Key Insight: The Magic is in the Middle

The Middle section is what makes CTB different from flowcharts. 
It contains all the operational intelligence, promotion gates, 
and failure handling that real systems need.
```

## Commands Section

### Section Title
```
Get Started in 2 Minutes
From zero to doctrine-compliant in three commands
```

### Command Cards

#### Validate Card
```
1. VALIDATE YOUR BLUEPRINT

npm run validate:ctb

✅ Checks all five doctrine pillars
✅ Validates schema compliance  
✅ Reports promotion gate status
✅ CI/CD ready - blocks PRs on violations

Output: "🎄 CTB Blueprint is doctrine-compliant!"
```

#### Visualize Card
```
2. SEE THE VISUALIZATION  

npm run illustration:dev

✅ Beautiful dark-themed UI
✅ Interactive HEIR canopy
✅ Vertical IMO cards with emphasized Middle
✅ ORBT and CARB badges
✅ Schema foundation panel

Visit: http://localhost:3000/illustration
```

#### Deploy Card
```
3. DEPLOY WITH CONFIDENCE

git commit && git push

✅ GitHub Actions validates doctrine
✅ PRs blocked if schema drifts
✅ Whimsical export stays in sync
✅ Team alignment enforced

Result: Production-ready doctrine compliance
```

## Benefits Section

### Section Title
```
Why Teams Choose CTB Doctrine
Stop fighting architecture drift - enforce it automatically
```

### Benefit Cards

#### Doctrine Enforcement
```
✅ NEVER LOSE ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY

• PRs automatically blocked on doctrine violations
• Schema drift caught before merge
• Team alignment enforced, not hoped for
• Architectural decisions become durable

"Finally, architecture that stays consistent as the team grows."
```

#### Visual Clarity
```
✅ COMPLEX SYSTEMS BECOME CLEAR

• HEIR canopy shows governance layer
• Vertical IMO reveals operational intelligence  
• ORBT discipline guides daily operations
• Whimsical export for stakeholder communication

"Our executives finally understand our technical architecture."
```

#### Operational Intelligence
```
✅ EVERY NODE HAS OPERATIONAL GUIDANCE

• No more "how do I fix this?" moments
• Clear operate/repair/build/train guidance
• Promotion gates prevent quality issues
• Failure handling built into every component

"On-call rotations become manageable with ORBT discipline."
```

#### Schema Grounding
```
✅ THREE-TIER DATA STRATEGY BUILT-IN

• STAMPED (Neon) for reliable persistence
• SPVPET (Firebase) for real-time needs
• STACKED (BigQuery) for analytics
• No floating abstractions or data silos

"Our data architecture finally makes sense to everyone."
```

## Live Example Section

Real node from our blueprint template
```

### Example Node Preview
```
🔷 Blueprint Registry Node [10k altitude]

📥 Input:
• Vision payload (40k→1k altitude JSON)
• Process constants & variables

⚙️ Middle (Orchestration Bay):
🎭 Orchestrator: Garage-MCP
🔧 Tools: Zod validator, Firebase Admin, Neon Client
📋 Operations:
  • Schema validate: CTB schema checks + doctrine ID attach
  • Version-lock: Hash blueprint + write registry record
🚪 Promotion Gate: ✅ HEIR pass, ORBT operate OK
🔥 Human Firebreak: ✅ Manual approval required

📤 Output:
• Approved blueprint version  
• CTB render config

🔄 ORBT Discipline:
• Operate: Serve current blueprint to UI
• Repair: Rollback to last-known good, Flag invalid schema
• Build: Add node types, Doctrine upgrades  
• Train: Authoring guide, Examples gallery

🏷️ Badges: DOCTRINE-LOCKED • VALIDATED • PROMOTION-GATE
